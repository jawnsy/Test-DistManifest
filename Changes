1.003 - 20 Aug 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Remove generated files from the repository
  + Use a simple string version, per David Golden's article:
    http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/
  + No longer use Perl::Critic to test
  + Remove modules available in core since Perl 5.6
    from requires
  + Move CIRCULAR.SKIP and MANIFEST.EXTRA into t/

1.2.3 - 25 Jul 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Added coverage information
  + Rewrote LICENSE and README slightly
  + Updated the checkmanifest.t example file and synopsis,
    it now checks Alias' flags (AUTOMATED_TESTING,
    RELEASE_TESTING) rather than TEST_AUTHOR
  + No longer test Perl::Critic during AUTOMATED_TESTING,
    only RELEASE_TESTING. Thanks to Elliot Shank for the
    discussion in a private mail.
  + No more versioned dependency on version.pm
  + Use a generic README, no longer produce one
  + Changed critic.rc to ignore PodSpelling policy (fixes
    a bug in Debian, BTS#538115 -- when Pod::Spell and
    other dependencies are installed)
  + Disable "one dot only" in filenames (portability test).
    This breaks compatibility with OpenVMS.
  + Updated perlcriticrc with new preferences, removed
    "no critic" stuff for those in Test/DistManifest.pm
  + Added copyleft statements to test files
  + Minor documentation fix
  + Small POD fix

1.2.2 - 15 May 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Minor problem forgetting to bump one of the version
    numbers in META.yml
  + Adjusted dependencies - changed minimum version
    dependency to Test::Builder 0.72 and version 0.74,
    which are core modules in Perl 5.10

1.2.1 - 14 May 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Moved some small changes from MANIFEST.SKIP to
    CIRCULAR.SKIP
  + This release is particularly important to get rid of
    Win32 test failures, where `Build.bat' is created
    instead of `Build'

1.2.0 - 14 May 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Updated t/03warn-only.t test with new semantics (always
    fail if parsing fails)
  + Note that circular dependencies and parsing errors will
    always be considered fatal, regardless of the setting
    MANIFEST_WARN_ONLY
  + Suppress refactoring requirement - even though
    manifest_ok is really complex, it doesn't make sense
    to exist in separate subs
  + Added new feature for nonfatal errors (see updated POD)

1.1.4 - 26 Apr 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Added .tmp to MANIFEST.SKIP
  + Added Build.bat to MANIFEST.SKIP for Win32 builds...

1.1.3 - 23 Apr 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Added Win32 compatibility code. Closes the Win32
    compatibility bug (RT#44401)
  + Updated Build.PL
  + Added META.yml
  + Changed to a passthrough Makefile instead of a classic
    one
  + Updated version dependency for version.pm
  + Removed use of Test::Prereq, because it needs to use
    CPAN to do its work
  + Fix OS detection routines
  + Modified the module so that it works portably (even
    with Win32, and other platforms File::Spec supports)

1.1.2 - 14 Mar 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Updated prerequisite information in Build.PL and META.yml
  + Add a more thorough description for the POD
  + Fix dependencies in Build.PL and META.yml
  + Clarified licensing restrictions
  + CIRCULAR.SKIP became out of sync with the real
    MANIFEST.SKIP, and so was causing problems with debian/

1.1.1 - 12 Mar 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Added "^debian/" as a mask for MANIFEST.SKIP. This is
    where Debian package control files go, and so should
    not be considered part of the package. Hopefully this
    won't break anything :-)

1.1.0 - 12 Mar 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>
  + Modified Changelog name to "Changes" (instead of CHANGES)
  + Updated Makefile.PL
  + Added a test for circular dependencies (those that exist
    in both MANIFEST and MANIFEST.SKIP) -- thanks Apocalypse!
  + Updated the POD and the README to reflect this repository's
    location
  + Fixed version number in META.yml -> numeric "1.001000"
    style version numbering, to get around version.pm bugs
  + Replaced PerlCritic's POD section to enforce 'LICENSE'
    instead of 'COPYRIGHT' (which is used by CPANTS/Kwalitee)
  + Removed Test::NoWarnings from the Signature test, which
    throws warnings on purpose.

1.0 - 25 Dec 2008 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Initial release

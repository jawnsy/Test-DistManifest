NAME
    Test::DistManifest - Verify MANIFEST/MANIFEST.SKIP as an author test

$Id$

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple method of testing that a MANIFEST matches
    the distribution.

COMPATIBILITY
    This module was tested under Perl 5.10.0, using Debian Linux. However,
    because it's Pure Perl and doesn't do anything too obscure, it should be
    compatible with any version of Perl that supports its prerequisite
    modules.

    If you encounter any problems on a different version or architecture,
    please contact the maintainer.

CAVEATS
  KNOWN BUGS
    There are no known bugs as of this release.

  LIMITATIONS
    *   There is currently no way to test a MANIFEST/MANIFEST.SKIP without
        having the files actually exist on disk. I am planning for this to
        change in the future.

    *   This module has not been tested very thoroughly with Unicode.

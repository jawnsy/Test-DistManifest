NAME
    Test::DistManifest - Tests that your MANIFEST matches the distribution
    as it exists, excluding those in your MANIFEST.SKIP

VERSION
    Version 1.0 ($Id$)

EXPORTS
    By default, this module exports the following functions:

    *   manifest_ok

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple method of testing that a MANIFEST matches
    the distribution.

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::More;

      eval 'use Test::DistManifest';
      if ($@) {
        plan skip_all => 'Test::DistManifest required to test MANIFEST';
      }

      manifest_ok('MANIFEST', 'MANIFEST.SKIP'); # Default options

      manifest_ok(); # Functionally equivalent to above

COMPATIBILITY
    This module was tested under Perl 5.10.0, using Debian Linux. However,
    because it's Pure Perl and doesn't do anything too obscure, it should be
    compatible with any version of Perl that supports its prerequisite
    modules.

    If you encounter any problems on a different version or architecture,
    please contact the maintainer.

FUNCTIONS
  manifest_ok( $manifest , $skipfile )
    This subroutine checks the manifest list contained in $manifest by using
    "Module::Manifest" to determine the list of files and then checking for
    the existence of all such files. Then, it checks if there are any files
    in the distribution that were not specified in the $manifest file but do
    not match any regular expressions provided in the $skipfile exclusion
    file.

    If your MANIFEST file is generated by "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" or
    "Module::Build", then you shouldn't have any problems with these files.
    It's just a helpful test to remind you to update these files, using:

      $ make dist # For ExtUtils::MakeMaker
      $ ./Build dist # For Module::Build

GUTS
    This module internally plans 3 tests:

    1   MANIFEST and MANIFEST.SKIP can be parsed by "Module::Manifest"

    2   Check which files exist in the distribution directory that do not
        match an existing regular expression in MANIFEST.SKIP and not listed
        in the MANIFEST file. These files should either be excluded from the
        test by addition of a mask in MANIFEST.SKIP (in the case of
        temporary development or test files) or should be included in the
        MANIFEST.

    3   Check which files are specified in MANIFEST but do not exist on the
        disk. This usually occurs when one deletes a test or similar script
        from the distribution, or accidentally moves it.

    If you want to run tests on multiple different MANIFEST files, you can
    simply pass 'no_plan' to the import function, like so:

      use Test::DistManifest 'no_plan';

      # Multiple tests work properly now
      manifest_ok('MANIFEST', 'MANIFEST.SKIP');
      manifest_ok();
      manifest_ok('MANIFEST.OTHER', 'MANIFEST.SKIP');

    I doubt this will be useful to users of this module. However, this is
    used internally for testing and it might be helpful to you. You can also
    plan more tests, but keep in mind that the idea of "3 internal tests"
    may change in the future.

    Example code:

      use Test::DistManifest tests => 4;
      manifest_ok(); # 3 tests
      ok(1, 'is 1 true?');

CAVEATS
  KNOWN BUGS
    There are no known bugs as of this release.

  LIMITATIONS
    *   There is currently no way to test a MANIFEST/MANIFEST.SKIP without
        having the files actually exist on disk. I am planning for this to
        change in the future.

    *   This module has not been tested very thoroughly with Unicode.
